## **Election-Audit Summary**
With some modifications, this script can be used for any election, including one with more expansive voter data. 
- For example, the script could be modified to adapt to a different type of election (e.g., school board, U.S. senate, U.S. presidential).
- The script could also be modified to report out additional voter data in each election (e.g., vote breakdown by gender, ethnicity, zipcode)
