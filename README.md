## **Overview of the Election Audit**
A Colorado Board of Elections employee gave me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election:
1) Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2) Get a complete list of candidates who received votes. 
3) Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4) Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
5) Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6) Calculate the number of votes and percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.

## **Election-Audit Summary**
In addition to reusing the script to audit another congressional election, the script could be modified to audit other types of elections (e.g., school board, U.S. Senate, U.S. presidential). The script could also be modified to report out additional voter demographic data in each election (e.g., vote totals and percentages by gender, ethnicity, zipcode, income).
